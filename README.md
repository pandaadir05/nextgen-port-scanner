## Overview

NextGen Port Scanner is built to be:
- **Fast:** Uses Pythonâ€™s `asyncio` for concurrent port scanning.
- **Smart:** Integrates an AI/ML model to analyze service banners and flag potential vulnerabilities.
- **Scalable:** Supports distributed scanning with Celery and RabbitMQ.
- **User-Friendly:** Features a modern React dashboard for real-time monitoring.
- **Portable:** Fully containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.
- **Reliable:** CI/CD pipelines ensure consistent builds and quality assurance.

---

## Features

- **Asynchronous Scanning:** Scan thousands of ports concurrently.
- **AI-Based Vulnerability Analysis:** Evaluate service banners with a machine learning model.
- **Distributed Scanning:** Scale scanning tasks using Celery workers and RabbitMQ.
- **Real-Time Dashboard:** Visualize scan progress and results using a React interface.
- **Containerized Deployment:** Easy setup with Docker and Docker Compose.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.

---

## Architecture

- **Scanner Engine:** Core scanning logic using Python's `asyncio`.
- **AI Analysis Module:** Loads a trained model to predict vulnerabilities from banners.
- **API Server:** FastAPI backend exposes endpoints for scanning.
- **Distributed Worker:** Celery worker distributes scanning tasks via RabbitMQ.
- **Frontend Dashboard:** React app displays real-time scanning results.
- **Containerization:** All components are packaged with Docker.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions automates testing and builds.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Node.js and npm (for the React dashboard)

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nextgen-port-scanner.git
   cd nextgen-port-scanner
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up the React Dashboard:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Command-Line Scanner

Run a basic scan from the terminal:

```bash
python scanner.py 127.0.0.1 --start 1 --end 1024
```

### API Server

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
python server.py
```

Then send a POST request to the `/scan` endpoint (using curl or Postman):

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/scan" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"ip": "127.0.0.1", "start_port": 1, "end_port": 1024}'
```

### React Dashboard

Launch the frontend dashboard:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the dashboard.

---

## Docker & Deployment

Deploy all components using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**Services:**
- **API Server:** FastAPI on port 8000.
- **Celery Worker:** Processes distributed scanning tasks.
- **RabbitMQ:** Task broker on ports 5672 and 15672.
- **Frontend:** React dashboard on port 3000.

---

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and includes:
- Code checkout
- Python environment setup
- Dependency installation
- Running tests
- Building Docker images
